### Windows Directions

* [Responsive HTML 5 (Windows)](../DITA/Responsive_HTML5/)
* [Microsoft HTML Help File (Windows)](../DITA/Building_a_Computer.chm)
* [Kindle e-book-.mobi) (Windows)](../DITA/Kindle.mobi)

### Linux Directions:

* [Responsive HTML 5 (Linux)](../DITA/Linux/Responsive_HTML5/)
* [Microsoft HTML Help File (Linux)](../DITA/Linux/Building_a_Linux_Computer.chm)
* [Kindle e-book-.mobi (Linux)](../DITA/Linux/Linux-Kindle.mobi)

**Note:**

* The Microsoft HTML Help File must be downloaded to your computer and opened. The format is native to Windows, but CoolReader will work for Linux.
* The Kindle Windows version is best viewed through [Sumatra](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html). The Kindle Linux version works well with Calibre.
