<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">A few things must be considered when purchasing a hard
drive for your computer.</p>
<div class="p"><ul class="ul"><li class="li">Size (dimensions)</li>

<li class="li">Type (solid state vs traditional)</li>

<li class="li">Capacity</li>

<li class="li">Speed</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="p">The very first thing to consider for a hard drive is what your
case and motherboard will support. The case has drive bays (holding
spaces) made for certain types of hard drives. The larger bay is
for a traditional drive, while a smaller bay can hold a solid state
drive. Many have an area for both.</p>

<p class="p">There are two main types of hard drives to consider: solid state
and traditional. Solid state drives are faster to save information
and read it off the disk, and they use less power. If you want the
fastest machine possible, this is the drive you want. The operating
system will boot faster, games will work faster, and you will spend
less time waiting for programs to open.</p>

<p class="p">There is one drawbacks to solid state drives, however. They are
far more expensive than traditional drives for the same capacity.</p>

<p class="p">After you have selected the type, you should consider the capacity.
If you only intend to use your computer to surf the Internet and
do some basic word processing, then you only need enough for the operating
system and some basic software.</p>



<p class="p">To run Ubuntu, you should have about 25 GB.
But if you plan to run one of the minimal distributions such as
Puppy Linux, you can use as little as 512 MB.</p>

<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
<p class="p">Hard drives often state that they are
made for Windows, Mac, or Linux. The truth is that all hard drives
can work with Linux, so donâ€™t get discouraged by what it says in
the advertisement.</p>
</div>

<p class="p">The standard traditional hard drive speed is 7200 RPMs (Rotations
Per Minute), but some go as high as 15000 RPMs. Traditional drives
can have a transfer rate speed of 50-120 MB/s (megabytes per second) Of
course, the fastest drives are still solid state drives that regularly
have between 200-500 MB/s.</p>

<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">While in theory there are different types of interfaces
(with different cables) to connect the motherboard to your hard
drives, about 99% of them are SATA. If for some reason you have
another connector type, there are adapters to you buy to fit your
situation.</p>
