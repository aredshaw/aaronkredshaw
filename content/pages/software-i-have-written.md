I have written a number of programs in Java, Python, and JavaScript in order to improve my coding skills.

### [DebtPayoff](https://aaronkredshaw.com/debtpayoff/)

This is the largest program I have written in Java. It runs in a GUI (graphical user interface) and is designed to help you understand credit card debt.

### [Aredshaw.java](https://github.com/aredshaw/CodePractice/blob/master/JavaCode/Aredshaw.java)

This code is for a Java GUI version of my resume. It uses Swing, and the resume text is done in HTML.

### [Aredshaw.py](https://github.com/aredshaw/CodePractice/blob/master/PythonCode/Aredshaw.py)

On the same note, here is a Python GUI version of my resume done with Tkinter. However, the text is unformatted and not nearly as polished as the Java application.

## Coding practice programs

### </> Java

I feel the most comfortable with Java. I have worked with it the most and the longest. Most of the developer documentation I write now is Java based. To view the **60 Java programs** I wrote (for practice), see my [GitHub CodePractice page](https://github.com/aredshaw/CodePractice) and click on the Java folder.

### </> Python

I am beginning to feel pretty comfortable with Python. It is faster to write and easier to implement than Java. I now see why it has become such a popular programming language. While my company uses it a lot, I seldom work with it hands-on. Here are **93 Python programs** I wrote. You can view these at my [GitHub CodePractice page](https://github.com/aredshaw/CodePractice). Just click on the Python folder.

### </> JavaScript

I have had to deal with JavaScript often enough that I wanted to see how it worked. In the course of learning the basics, I wrote these **15 JavaScript programs**. View them on my [GitHub CodePractice page](https://github.com/aredshaw/CodePractice) and click on the JavaScript folder.
