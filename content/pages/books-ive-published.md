When I was a high school English teacher I sometimes wondered what it would be like to write a book. I had met several teachers who said that one day they would write a novel, but it just never seemed to happen. Then one day I thought to myself, "Why not stop dreaming and just do it!"

### Trivia
My first draft of my first book, *The Gifted*, only took me 11 days to complete (50,000 words). Revising it 13 times took another 9 months.
