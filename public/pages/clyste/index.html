Most of you are familiar with social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. This is where people connect, find out interesting news, and keep up with trends. But these models are developed from the top down by huge corporations, meaning that if someone wants to make a change, even a small change, there is a lot of red tape that needs to be gone through before any changes actually happen.">

<h1 id="clyste">Clyste</h1>
<p>(Pronounced Klīst)</p>
<p><a href="https://angel.co/clyste-social-network">https://angel.co/clyste-social-network</a></p>
<p>Most of you are familiar with social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. This is where people connect, find out interesting news, and keep up with trends. But these models are developed from the top down by huge corporations, meaning that if someone wants to make a change, even a small change, there is a lot of red tape that needs to be gone through before any changes actually happen. And those who benefit most will always be those corporations. That’s because they are corporate owned and operated.</p>
<p>Enter Clyste: A user owned, governed, and developed blockchain based Social Media, App Store, and ERP.</p>
<p>But what does that all mean? You know about social media, but what is this blockchain thing, and what about ERP?</p>
<p>Simply put, blockchain is a way to securely store information and make financial transactions securely, without any middleman, and with built-in accountability. You see, blockchain makes how a business interacts with others transparent and public. Everyone user has a copy of what’s going on, and all transactions can be traced and verified. No secrets here!</p>
<p>Did you know when you buy something online with your Visa or Mastercard, a part of what you pay goes to the credit card companies? Using blockchain eliminates all that. Because the money no longer needs a third-party but can be sent directly, it keeps costs down for the customer and the business. And it all happens in the blink of an eye. No need to wait for anything to be approved.</p>
<p><strong>ERP (Enterprise resource planning)</strong> just means that all the parts of the business that often have their own separate software systems (accounting, ordering, inventory, etc.), use the same system. Everything is stored within the blockchain itself. Now the accounting software does not have to attempt to communicate with the inventory software, which tries to communicate with the ordering system, which gets information from a tracking system. Having everything in one place securely saves time, money, and avoids common transcription mistakes.</p>
<p>Clyste is <strong>open source</strong>, so you can see what’s going on or better yet, be a part of improving it yourself. The software is developed by people like you who can make improvements or suggest changes or added features to the community.</p>
<p>Here are some things you will be able to do with Clyste:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be part of a growing community who shares life together</li>
<li>Give your input for improvement and see your ideas put to use</li>
<li>Be a part of the development team yourself (if you are so inclined)</li>
<li>Create your own apps and sell them through the store</li>
<li>Do your online shopping through any of a number of connected store</li>
</ul>
<p>And remember, with other social media sites, the platform is owned by a large corporation. It’s not really your forum, but theirs. They have all the control. But with Clyste, you call the shots, because it is owned and operated by you!</p>
<h1 id="notes-on-writing-this-document">Notes on writing this document</h1>
<p>For this first document, I interviewed the COO of Clyste for one hour, asked a lot of questions, and wrote extensive notes.</p>
<p>I had heard of blockchain before, but did not know much about it other than that it was used for Bitcoin. To get answers I did what anyone would do: I found a couple of videos on Youtube introducing the technology.</p>
<p>To understand ERP, I found some good websites describing the concept. Then I found one detailing how blockchain was a really smart way to implementing ERP.</p>
<p>After the research was done, I read over my notes several times and wrote notes on my notes. Organizing concepts, and thinking of analogies that might make the concepts easier to understand for the layperson.</p>
<p>I wrote a first draft, then revised it again and again, revising it for clarity and word choice. Brevity was important too, because I wanted it to fit neatly on one page. Also, the average person has very little attention for reading dense text, so I tried to make it as short and informative as possible.</p>
<p>The voice I used in writing it was as if viewing a video introduction to a new product. Perhaps this was because of my viewing the Youtube videos on blockchain. I also considered that the client (Clyste) might want to use it for a future video.</p>
<p>This document will also be the starting place to create a pamphlet I am currently working on for the product.</p>
