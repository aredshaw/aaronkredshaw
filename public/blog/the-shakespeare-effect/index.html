        <p>When I was in college, working my way towards a BA in English, I took a Shakespeare class. Besides all that we learned during lecture times, we were required to read six Shakespeare plays outside of class. So, several nights a week I found myself reading through a Shakespeare play, and most of the time I was utterly confused. Many of the words were modern words, but many were also new to me. Since it was written as poetry, the phrases were odd and didn&rsquo;t make much sense. Some ideas or historical references were also opaque. However, for these I had helpful notes in my textbook.</p>
<p>Night after night I sat down to read and got almost nothing for my labor&hellip;or so I thought. After about six weeks of continuous frustration, one night I remember reading as I usually did, but this time it seemed to make sense. This time I could follow the story, and I even understood the dialogue. It wasn&rsquo;t that I understood every single word or reference, but I understood the bulk of the meaning, and the change occurred all of a sudden, not slowly. At least that&rsquo;s the way it seemed. From that point on, I felt I could read any Shakespeare play and make sense of it, and for the most part, I did.</p>
<p>I have had this happen in other areas of my life, where I was trying to learn something completely new and somewhat difficult. Whether it was something about programming, or another subject, I found that if I pushed through when I was confused, there came a time when the light came on and it just got easier.</p>
<p>This happened to me a couple weeks ago when I was slogging my way through the Android course. Much of it has been foreign to me, and I find myself copying and pasting code I do not understand. Then one day a couple of weeks ago I felt like it was starting to make sense. But the truth is, I was still very confused. What happened? Here are my best guesses.</p>
<h2 id="putting-things-in-boxes">Putting things in boxes</h2>
<p>I think I started to categorize things over all that time I was confused. While I didn&rsquo;t understand anything specifically, I started to realize that some things could be lumped with other things. This became more clear over time. Strangely enough, just putting things in categories, makes them feel less overwhelming.</p>
<p>Part of the wonder of compartmentalizing knowledge is being able to wall off sections that are more confusing with the promise that I will revisit that area again and master it. Then I can focus on some parts I am starting to understand.</p>
<h2 id="accumulating-what-i-know">Accumulating what I know</h2>
<p>I could just break everything about this course down into two areas. Things I know, and things I don&rsquo;t know. At first everything was in the I don&rsquo;t know that category. Now, over time I have started to put some things in the I think I get this area. This is an area I hold closest to my chest, because it gives me hope. Now I can say, I may not know much, but at least I can say I know yada yada. As that area grows, my hope increases.</p>
<h2 id="seeing-patters">Seeing patters</h2>
<p>Having gone through a number of sections of this course now, even if I am confused, I can now say that I am noticing reoccurring patterns. There are ideas that are repeated, common terms being used, and procedures that come up again and again. When I see something multiple times, I start to realize that maybe the knowledge needed to master this course is not infinite, because they are already repeating themselves.</p>
<h2 id="seeing-the-larger-picture">Seeing the larger picture</h2>
<p>At the same time, I am starting to see the larger picture of Android development. How to think like a developer, the things I need to consider when creating an app, and how to troubleshoot apps as a whole to get things done. It&rsquo;s all part of the larger picture. Most of the specifics are still fuzzy, but seeing the overall process and getting familiar with that makes me feel like I&rsquo;m on secure ground. I may not get all the pieces and what they are made of, but I&rsquo;m starting to see how they fit together as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-an-area-of-study-to-find-that-thats-all-there-is">Finishing an area of study to find that that&rsquo;s all there is</h2>
<p>This may be related to putting things in categories, but I have finished whole sections of the course now. Once at the end of a section, I realize that to understand that area of knowledge, I only have to understand those few lessons. It&rsquo;s not infinite, it&rsquo;s only three days of study. And I can go through those lessons as many times as I need to to understand them. Coming to the end of a section gives me hope that there is an end to come to. And that&rsquo;s all there is to that topic. It has a beginning and an end, and I can always revisit it until I understand everything in-between.</p>
<h2 id="at-least-i-know-android-studio">At least I know Android Studio</h2>
<p>Even if I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing in the code most of the time, I am starting to get quite comfortable with Android Studio. This by itself is a real accomplishment, and it&rsquo;s an area of study in itself. It is one of the goals of the course as well. I can add this to one thing I can do, and it makes things seem more possible. Trying to learn both a software package and incomprehensible code at the same time is overwhelming, but now it&rsquo;s just the code that&rsquo;s a mystery, and that already feels better.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m still in the dark about a lot of what I&rsquo;m doing right now, but I feel like I turned a corner. This feeling like I can do this comes in degrees. In a couple of months I will probably have such an epiphany moment happen again, but not until slogging through the hard stuff for awhile. It happens in stages, like steps. Strangely enough, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be so gradual though. It&rsquo;s sudden realizations that I&rsquo;m getting this, or I can do this, that make all the difference when learning a difficult piece of technology. We can only get to this point if we don&rsquo;t give up. It takes pushing through for these epiphany moments. It&rsquo;s how we learn the hard things to become something new. Or as Shakespeare said, We know what we are, but know not what we may be.</p>
