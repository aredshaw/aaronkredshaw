      <description>Before you invest time, and possibly money, into getting into a technical writing career, you should first decide if it&amp;rsquo;s the kind of job you would like.&#xA;Keep in mind you probably won’t identify with everything in these lists, but if technical writing is a job you’d like, you may see some familiar patterns here.&#xA;Questions to answer - The big 3 There are lots of possible questions to answer to know if you would like technical writing, but I think these might be the big 3:</description>

      <title>What should I study first?</title>

      <description>If you want to get a job as a technical writer, you will have to get technical. Since I&amp;rsquo;m often asked what to study first, I&amp;rsquo;ve put together some guiding principles so you can figure out where to spend your time learning the technical subjects.&#xA;I won&amp;rsquo;t tell you what to study first, but I&amp;rsquo;ll give you what you need to make that decision. As usual, I&amp;rsquo;m assuming you want to document software using a docs-as-code approach, which is where my experience lies.</description>

      <title>What are APIs anyway?</title>

      <description>Introduction to APIs When people use the term APIs, they are not all talking about the same thing. This used to confuse me early on, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to give you a very quick tour of APIs. If you want more in-depth knowledge, there is a ton of information online.&#xA;To start, API stands for Application Programming Interface. It’s a way that software can exchange information with other software. Since knowing how to document APIs is in very high demand for software technical writers, I’m going to also provide resources for learning more about each type.</description>

      <description>Get experience with an open source project GitHub | Linux | GNU | Sourceforge&#xA;Common advice The idea that you can get a job in technical writing by volunteering to write documentation for an open source project has been around awhile. This advice often appears in blog posts, tech writing forums, and advice columns. The prevailing logic is that you can add to your portfolio by writing documentation for some of the many open source software projects available.</description>

      <description>Get any job in an IT industry, and try to work your way into a tech writing position If you’ve been applying for technical writing jobs, you may have discovered that no one will hire you without experience. In that case, you may try getting a job in a technical company, and see if you can work your way into technical writing. If you are currently employed, you may do this in your current company.</description>

      <description>The problem &amp;ldquo;How can I get experience in technical writing when all the entry-level jobs require experience?&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this a lot. It&amp;rsquo;s perhaps the most difficult issue to overcome when trying to get into technical writing. Just today I looked up entry level positions for technical writing on Indeed. I saw only one in my area, and here’s what it said:&#xA;3-6 years? I have seen many other entry level positions like this, usually requiring 1-3 years of experience.</description>

      <title>The importance of humility</title>

      <description>When trying to get a job in technical writing, or even once you have one, humility can serve you well. Sometimes humility is learned the hard way, by running into a wall, or being turned down a few dozen times. Fortunately, we don’t have to wait for that to happen to learn humility. Here are some thoughts I have about its importance in your job search.&#xA;I don’t know what I don’t know Here’s the thing.</description>

      <title>The technical writing interview – part 2</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/the-technical-writing-interview-part-2/</link>

      <description>In this second post on the technical writing interview, I’ll focus on the technical section of the interview itself. For behavioral interview advice, as well as how to prepare for other general interview questions, see The technical writing interview – Part 1.&#xA;This post will be based on the kind of technical writing I do. It’s what I’ve heard some refer to as technical technical writing. Specifically, it uses the docs as code approach to technical writing.</description>

      <description>This topic is divided into two posts:&#xA;Part 1 covers more of the non-technical aspects of the interview. A lot of this might work for any interview in any field, but the examples will mostly be specific to technical writing. If you take this part seriously, you really sabotage your chances of getting the job.&#xA;Part 2 will focus on the technical aspects. This will be from my own experience, for the type of technical writing I do.</description>

      <title>What kind of technical writing job should I get into?</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a technical writing job, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed with all the possible job requirements. The truth is there are many types of technical writing jobs, and each has its own requirements. For that reason, there is no need to study all the requirements for every category of technical writing job. Picking a target type and working towards that kind of job can save you from being quite so overwhelmed and may get you a job faster.</description>

      <title>Tech writing hiring freeze</title>

      <description>I hope the title caught your attention, because if you are in the market to get hired as a technical writer, keep a watch on your calendar. In general, most companies stop hiring around the end of October (sometimes weeks earlier), and start again around mid-January. This often has to do with approved budgets for headcount, and also businesses just start hunkering down as the holidays approach.&#xA;What should I do about it?</description>

      <description>When I was in college, working my way towards a BA in English, I took a Shakespeare class. Besides all that we learned during lecture times, we were required to read six Shakespeare plays outside of class. So, several nights a week I found myself reading through a Shakespeare play, and most of the time I was utterly confused. Many of the words were modern words, but many were also new to me.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing. I&amp;rsquo;m completely lost in this Android course. I&amp;rsquo;m copying and pasting code, and sometimes it compiles and works and sometimes it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. I get some of the concepts, but most are over my head at this point. I know if I slow down too much, I will get bogged down and feel like I&amp;rsquo;m going nowhere. With enough repetition, this will get better in later iterations. As long as I don&amp;rsquo;t stop.</description>

      <description>The thing about getting into technical writing, is that most employers care more about your technical mastery than they do your writing ability. For that reason, one of the best ways to show your value is to prove your technical skills. The list of what you can learn is just about infinite, and choosing what will impress employers can be difficult. (See my spreadsheet if you are looking for how to narrow this down.</description>

      <description>As I have said before, when getting into technical writing, experience is king. But when you might have difficulty getting experience, the next best thing you can do is gain technical know-how. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently stumbled upon Google Certificates. These are courses that are offered either through Google or through a partnership with Google and Coursera, and they are intended to help people get into high-growth technical jobs.&#xA;According to their site, 82% of Certificate graduates report a positive career impact in six months, though so far, these statistics mostly come from the IT Support course, which was their first.</description>

      <description>This post will not get into resume writing basics. There are some great guides out there for free already on that topic. Here I will just cover what is specific to technical writing.&#xA;Keywords are key According to Josh Hrala at careerminds.com, 17% of all resumes submitted are never read by a human being. Instead, they are processed by an ATS (applicant tracking system), which searches for certain keywords that match the job description.</description>

      <title>Technical skills trump writing skills</title>

      <description>If you are trying to get into technical writing, you may find it is a sad fact that much more emphasis is placed on your technical skills than your writing skills. It seems it is assumed that writing is easier to pick up than technical skills. Or perhaps the assumption is that everyone can write, but not everyone has technical know-how. Take a look at this list of requirements for a fairly low-level technical writer position I found (really, it was the first one that came up on Indeed).</description>

      <description>As I said in the last post, How to get a job in technical writing, there are two big issues that you have to overcome to get into technical writing.&#xA;Experience is king. Technical skills trump writing skills Before I go into each solution in detail, I want to give you an idea of how problematic these obstacles are. I had a number of phone interviews that began and ended with the phrase, “How many years of experience do you have as a technical writer.</description>

      <description>There are two categories of people interested in technical writing. Those who have received a degree or certificate in technical writing, and those who want to make the switch from another career. While you might think those with a degree or certificate have all the advantages in the job market, that is simply not the case. Without experience and a good portfolio, employers will seldom even consider a candidate.&#xA;Since I recently made the switch into technical writing, I thought I’d pass on what I learned along the way.</description>
